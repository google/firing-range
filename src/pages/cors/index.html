<h2>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</h2>
<div class="intro">
  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows websites to control cross-origin access to their
  resources. The test cases showcase various misconfigurations.

  <p>Tests verifying the soundness of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="/cors/alloworigin/dynamicAllowOrigin">Insecure dynamic header generation</a> -
      Developers cannot use the wildcard (<code>*</code>) to allow multiple origins while at the
      same time allowing authenticated requests. This is why many implementations create dynamic
      responses based on the <code>Origin</code> header. If an endpoint blindly allows all origins
      while at the same time allowing authenticated requests, either the resource should not require
      authentication or it is too sensible to be shared across origin boundaries. This test case
      blindly replays the <code>Origin</code> header in the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>
      header.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/cors/alloworigin/allowNullOrigin">Allows null origin</a> -
      Allowing the <code>null</code> origin in an <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header is
      equivalent to allowing every origin. Combined with allowing authenticated requests, the same
      concerns as with <i>insecure dynamic header generation</i> apply.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/cors/alloworigin/allowInsecureScheme">Allows insecure scheme</a> -
      If an HTTP origin can perform authenticated requests to an HTTPS origin, the purpose of
      SSL/TLS encryption in terms of web security is defeated.
    </li>
  </ul>
